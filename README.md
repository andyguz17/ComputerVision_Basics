#### About

In this repository I try to accomplish a Basics Computer Vision course, consider it just like a brief introduciton so you can start with this field of study. You will find some examples and theory about important basic topics. All this is build with python 3.5 and opencv 3. Feel free to change the python version, some features may change but it keeps the idea. If you have any suggestions or doubts do not hesitate on contacting me!
